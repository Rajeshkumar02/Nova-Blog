## Introduction

In the vibrant world of mobile app development, creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces is paramount.
React Native, a powerful framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, offers developers a plethora of tools
and techniques to achieve this goal. One such technique that significantly enhances the user experience is implementing
custom themes.

Themes not only dictate the visual appearance of your application but also contribute to its overall aesthetic and
brand identity. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of implementing custom themes in React Native,
empowering you to craft dynamic and immersive UIs for your mobile apps.

## Understanding the Fundamentals

Before diving into the implementation details, let's grasp the fundamentals of custom themes in React Native.
At its core, a theme encompasses a set of stylistic attributes such as colors, typography, and spacing that define
the look and feel of an application. By utilizing themes, developers can seamlessly switch between different visual
styles and accommodate user preferences, creating a personalized experience for each user.

## Building a Theme Provider

The cornerstone of our custom theme implementation lies in the `ThemeProvider` component. This component serves as
the central hub for managing theme-related logic and providing theme context to other components within the application.
Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:

1. **Dynamic Theme Detection**: Leveraging the Appearance module, our `ThemeProvider` detects the device's color scheme
   (light or dark) and initializes the theme accordingly. Additionally, it provides an option to override this detection
   with a custom theme.
2. **Theme Switching**: The toggleTheme function enables users to seamlessly switch between light and dark themes,
   enhancing accessibility and catering to individual preferences.
3. **Theme Configuration**: Developers can customize various aspects of the theme such as colors, typography, and spacing by
   providing a themeConfig object to the `ThemeProvider`.

### Building a Foundation: Folder Structure

Before we delve into the intricacies of custom themes in React Native, let's establish a solid foundation by organizing
our project structure. A well-structured folder hierarchy enhances modularity, maintainability, and scalability, ensuring
that our custom theme implementation remains robust and flexible.

### Folder Structure

<div className=" p-4 border rounded-lg w-fit">
  <FileTree>
    <FileTreeFolder name="DynamicUI" defaultOpen>
      <FileTreeFolder name="node_modules" />
      <FileTreeFolder name="src" defaultOpen>
        <FileTreeFolder name="components">
          <FileTreeFile name="Button.tsx" />
          <FileTreeFile name="Text.tsx" />
        </FileTreeFolder>
        <FileTreeFolder name="routes">
          <FileTreeFile name="AuthRoute.tsx" />
          <FileTreeFile name="HomeRoute.tsx" />
          <FileTreeFile name="AppRoute.tsx" />
        </FileTreeFolder>
        <FileTreeFolder name="screens">
          <FileTreeFile name="HomeScreen.tsx" />
          <FileTreeFile name="ProfileScreen.tsx" />
        </FileTreeFolder>
        <FileTreeFolder name="service">
          <FileTreeFile name="user.service.ts" />
        </FileTreeFolder>
        <FileTreeFolder name="utils" defaultOpen>
          <FileTreeFolder name="theme" defaultOpen>
            <FileTreeFolder name="color" defaultOpen>
              <FileTreeFile name="index.ts" />
              <FileTreeFile name="types.d.ts" />
            </FileTreeFolder>
            <FileTreeFile name="index.ts" />
            <FileTreeFile name="types.d.ts" />
          </FileTreeFolder>
          <FileTreeFile name="localstorage.ts" />
        </FileTreeFolder>
      </FileTreeFolder>
      <FileTreeFile name="App.tsx" />
      <FileTreeFile name="package.json" />
      <FileTreeFile name="tsconfig.json" />
    </FileTreeFolder>
  </FileTree>
</div>

Within our project's directory structure lies a hidden gem - the `utils/theme` directory. This enclave houses
essential utilities that power our application's theming capabilities. Let's embark on a journey to unravel its
secrets and understand how it contributes to our dynamic UI experience.

### Understanding the Theme Structure

At the heart of the theme directory lies the color subdirectory. Here, we define color-related configurations for
different themes, laying the foundation for our application's visual identity.

- **color/**: This directory contains color definitions and configurations for various themes, allowing us to maintain
  consistency and coherence in our UI design.

### Key Files and Definitions

As we delve deeper, we encounter two pivotal files that shape our theme utilities:

- **index.ts**: This file serves as the nexus of our theme utilities. It exports theme-related constants,
  configurations, and functions, enabling seamless integration of themes throughout our application.
- **types.d.ts**: TypeScript declaration files provide type definitions for theme-related objects. These definitions
  ensure type safety and enhance developer productivity by providing clear and concise interfaces for working with themes.

The `utils/theme` directory serves as a cornerstone of our application's theming infrastructure. Through meticulous organization
and thoughtful design, it empowers us to create dynamic and immersive UI experiences that resonate with our users. As we
continue to explore the depths of our project's directory structure, let's cherish the ingenuity and craftsmanship that
underpin our theme utilities.

## Unraveling the Components: Code Breakdown

1. **src/utils/theme/index.tsx**

```js title="index.ts" showLineNumbers
import React, { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Appearance, type ColorSchemeName } from 'react-native';
import type { ThemeContextProps, ThemeProviderProps } from './types';
import { CUSTOM_THEME, DARK_THEME, LIGHT_THEME } from './color';
import type { Theme } from './color/types';

const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextProps | undefined>(undefined);

export const ThemeProvider: React.FC<ThemeProviderProps> = ({
  children,
  themeConfig = {},
  useTheme = 'light',
}) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<ColorSchemeName | 'custom'>(
    useTheme || Appearance.getColorScheme() || 'light'
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Appearance.addChangeListener(({ colorScheme }) => {
      setTheme(colorScheme || 'light');
    });

    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => {
      if (prevTheme === 'light') {
        return 'dark';
      } else if (prevTheme === 'dark') {
        return 'light';
      } else {
        return 'light';
      }
    });
  };

  const getColorsForTheme = () => {
    const themeColors =
      theme === 'light'
        ? {
            ...LIGHT_THEME,
            ...themeConfig.light,
          }
        : theme === 'dark'
          ? {
              ...DARK_THEME,
              ...themeConfig.dark,
            }
          : {
              ...CUSTOM_THEME,
              ...themeConfig.custom,
            };

    return themeColors;
  };

  const colors: Theme = getColorsForTheme();

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider
      value={
        {
          theme: theme as ColorSchemeName,
          toggleTheme,
          colors,
        } as ThemeContextProps
      }
    >
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
```

This file serves as the nexus of our theme utilities. It exports theme-related constants,
configurations, and functions, enabling seamless integration of themes throughout our application

2. **src/utils/theme/types.d.ts**

```js title="types.d.ts" showLineNumbers
import { ColorSchemeName, Record } from "react-native";

export type CustomColors = {
  light?: Theme,
  dark?: Theme,
  custom?: Theme,
};

export type ThemeContextProps = {
  theme: ColorSchemeName,
  toggleTheme: () => void,
  colors: Theme,
};

export type ThemeProviderProps = {
  children: React.ReactNode,
  themeConfig?: CustomColors,
  useTheme?: ColorSchemeName | "custom",
  customColors?: CustomColors,
};
```

TypeScript declaration files provide type definitions for theme-related objects. These definitions
ensure type safety and enhance developer productivity by providing clear and concise interfaces for working with themes.

3. **src/utils/theme/color/index.ts**

## How to use the ThemeProvider 🤔

How to use the ThemeProvider in your React Native application to enable dynamic theming and customization capabilities
first import the ThemeProvider from the theme utilities and wrap your application's root component with it.

```js title="App.tsx" showLineNumbers {22,24}
import { NavigationContainer } from "@react-navigation/native";
import AppRout from "@routes/AppRoute";
import { UserProvider } from "@utils/UserContext";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@utils/theme";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useColorScheme } from "react-native";

const App = () => {
  const deviceColorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const [currentTheme, setCurrentTheme] = useState(
    deviceColorScheme || "light"
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Device color scheme:", deviceColorScheme);
    setCurrentTheme(deviceColorScheme || "light");
  }, [deviceColorScheme]);

  return (
    <UserProvider>
      <NavigationContainer>
        <ThemeProvider useTheme={currentTheme}>
          <AppRout />
        </ThemeProvider>
      </NavigationContainer>
    </UserProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, we import the ThemeProvider from the theme utilities and wrap our application's root component with it.

- We use the useColorScheme hook from react-native to detect the device's color scheme (light, dark or custom).
- The currentTheme state variable stores the current theme value, which is initialized with the device's color scheme.
- We update the currentTheme state whenever the device's color scheme changes, ensuring that our application's theme
  remains in sync with the device settings.

**You can use the colors by using the following method:**

Import the `colors` from useTheme and use the dynamic colors in your application.

**eg.**

```js title="Button.tsx" showLineNumbers {3,6}
import React from "react";
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from "react-native";
import { useTheme } from "@utils/theme";

const Button = ({ title, onPress }) => {
  const { colors } = useTheme();

  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={{
        backgroundColor: colors.PRIMARY,
        padding: 16,
        borderRadius: 8,
      }}
      onPress={onPress}
    >
      <Text style={{ color: colors.PRIMARY_FOREGROUND }}>{title}</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};

export default Button;
```

If you want to toggele the theme in your application, you can use the `toggleTheme` function from the useTheme hook.

we have used the dynamic import (alis path) to import the theme utilities in our application.
This allows us to maintain a clean and concise import structure, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
